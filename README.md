### Ad Material
When you find yourself in a situation where you want to be able to access a command fast, you may realize you can be 1 click away.

One of the biggest complaints I have found about macro mods in the past is that they aren't for forge, but also that they sometimes just don't work on servers without the mod installed on the server. With MacroKey I made that the mod is fully functional while in single- and multiplayer worlds. No server side mods required!
